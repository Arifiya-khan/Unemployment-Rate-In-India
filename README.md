# Unemployment-Rate-In-India
As we Know that Unemployment rate is kept on increasing in India especially in Covid times So I thought of Analysing the data of an unemployed people.By this data I found that most unemployed people are from urban areas due to lack of industries or companies.The solution that came out through this data was to increase the number of industries in India so that most of the people could get employed.
Here on this data,I used Random forest regression and gradient boosting.

Random Forest:-Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification,
regression and other task, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and
outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the
individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training
set.
To say it in simple words: Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together
to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

Gradient Boosting:-Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which
produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision
trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them
by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.
